%Scraps commented out from introduction (moved on 3/11)
%make the above abstract ideas more concrete - 
%***DAN: This para commented out for length, added a sentence about the systems to the above paragraph to take the place of this text
%To make the above ideas more concrete, we briefly mention examples from prior work to 
%which the ideas may apply. 
%\cite{Chesson_2012} provides two examples of competitive plant communities in which different species
%are likely influenced differently by phenologically distict environmental variables: an Australian 
%grass-forb community, and an Arizona community of desert annuals. 
%The communities follow the criteria required for temporal storage effects to operate \citep{Chesson_2012}. In both 
%examples, distinct species have different periods of germination, competition is influenced by resource 
%consumption, and population growth is buffered by overlapping generations or via seed banks.
%Temporal differences between species in germination rates suggest the possibility that 
%population growth of distinct species may be driven by rainfall signals in distinct parts
%of the growing season. Thus all the ingredients seem to be present by which climatic changes may
%alter ATAs between environmental variables which are relevant for the coexistence
%of the example species, motivating our efforts, here, to perform a detailed study of how ATAs can influence competition.

%Review of lit on changes in means and variances of climate signals and associated impacts on coexistence
%**DAN: this para commetned out for length, added a couple of sentences to an aboce para to substitute
%Although, to our knowledge, the potential importance of climatic changes in ATAs for species coexistence has 
%not been studied, the importance for coexistence of changes 
%in means and variability of environmental variables has been studied in many systems. We briefly 
%review some of that literature.
%\cite{diPaola_2012} concluded that coexistence of drought sensitive,
%flood resistant species with flood sensitive, drought resistant species in 
%Mediteranean coastal swamp forests of central Italy would be jeopardized
%by projected changes in mean rainfall. 
%\cite{Descombes_2020} found that if warming trends promote faster expansion toward 
%higher altitudes of herbivore populations than of plant populations, newly arrived
%herbivores at high altitudes can inflate plant species richness by reducing dominant plant species 
%in favor of subordinates. Contrastingly, \cite{Usinowicz_2021} concluded, also for
%alpine plants, that upward range expansion under warming trends would be good for the growth and survival of 
%all species they considered, but that changes in competition would more than offset these direct benefits. 
%Numerous studies take an ``event-focused'' 
%perspective \citep{Jentsch_2007}, examining how increased climatic variability, in the
%form of extreme weather events, can alter competitive interactions. For instance, 
%\cite{White_2001} showed that single extreme heat events can alter competition 
%between C3 and C4 plants. And \cite{Parepa_2013} showed that extreme variability in soil
%nutrient availability for plants, mediated by soil moisture content, can alter 
%the potential for invasive species to enter an ecosystem and establish, a process that involves
%the invader overcoming competition from resident species. 
%Using MCT, it has been demonstrated that increased variability can promote coexistence in plant 
%communities, via storage effects \citep{Adler_2006,  Angert_2009}.

%***DAN: Jasmin, I commented the below sentence because that body of work is famously 
%complex and sophisticated, and I did not feel we could do it justice in short space.
%decreased growth season precipitation can decrease the competitive ability of dominant 
%forest tree species \citep{Clark_2011}, 
%***DAN: Jasmin, I commented the below sentence because I'm not sure the two studies 
%cited there are actually directly about coexistence, in the MCT sense. One of them is
%a general review on invasive species, and the other has to do with competition,
%but coexistence is not mentioned. I searched both papers for "coexist" and found
%no hits. OK, both are relevant, but maybe not so directly, to what we are talking about,
%and since this paragraph could anyway stand to be shortened a bit, I took these out.
%Alternatively, dominant species exclusion may be beneficial as rare species can increase 
%in diversity \citep{Mariotte_2013}, while an increase in dominant species fitness can 
%reduce community diversity, typical of invasive species \citep{Vitousek_1997}. 

%Scraps from discussion

We provided a further tertiary decomposition to MCT, 
extending the framework put forward by \citep{Ellner_2019}. 
We decompose the storage effect into two new terms, 
$\Delta_i^{[EC]}$, the contribution of ATAs, and $\Delta_i^{[E \nat C]}$, 
the contribution of correlation \emph{per se}. 
Previously, storage effects were described as the contribution
of covariance between the environment and competition to 
coexistence \citep{Chesson_2012, Ellner_2016, Ellner_2019}. 
However, the description of storage effects as the covariance between drivers
is a misnomer in terminology, and we propose that storage effects, instead, 
should be described as the contribution of the relationship between drivers. 
All aspects and of the relationship between environmental response and competitive pressure 
are not fully captured by only the covariance between them because a measure of covariance 
does not capture the structure of associativity throughout the distribution of the relationship 
and any asymmetries there may be. 
Thus, it is misleading to describe the contribution of the whole EC relationship 
as the contribution of EC covariance.
In addressing this inconsistency, we have separated the mechanisms of storage effect 
into the contribution of ATA [to storage effect/coexistence] and the contribution of 
correlation \emph{per se} [to storage effect/coexistence].




%[As we know], anthropogenic climate change threatens almost all aspects of life including via extreme climatic events, which have only become more extreme - increasing in magnitude and frequency - and have contributed to both the increase in global means as well as an increase in environmental variability (citation). 
%There are many studies on the influence of environmental extremes and variability on competition and coexistence \citep{Adler_2006,  Parepa_2013, Diez_2012}; however, the study of the influence of relationships and interactions between drivers in their extremes on competition and coexistence, is lacking in the scientific literature.
%;we review these studies here  In one of the first empirical tests for storage effect and its requirements, \cite{Adler_2006} showed that climate variability - including extreme events - promoted the coexistence of grass species in Kansas prairie, specifically their ability to recover from low densities. Moreover, in studies on the invasibility of plants, the density and competitive balance of invasive Japanese knotweed increases as resource and thus climate variability increased.\citep{Parepa_2013}

\section{Invasion growth rate of species 1, and storage effects} \label{sect:IGR}

We consider the invasion growth rate of species 1, $\bar r_1=\EX(\ln (\frac{N_1(t+1)}{N_1(t)}))$, when $N_1$ is close to 0 and $N_2$ is close to $N$.
Hence $\EX(\cdot)$ represents expected value.
We have 

\begin{equation}
\frac{N_1(t+1)}{N_1(t)}=(1-\delta)+\delta N \frac{B_1(t)}{B_1(t)N_1(t)+B_2(t)N_2(t)},  \label{sp1_Nt+1_over_Nt}
\end{equation}

\noindent but setting $N_1=0$ and $N_2=N$ here gives the result that

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1=\EX(\ln [(1-\delta)+\delta \exp(b_1-b_2)]).  \label{rbar1_E}
\end{equation}

\noindent We considered the various cases for the joint distribution $(b_1,b_2)$, specified in the main text and in the previous section. 

To study storage effect for the model, we also consider the contribution of EC covariance to the difference between the invader's and the resident's mean growth rates, to be denoted $\Delta I$. 
Following REF, we define 

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1^\#=\EX(\ln [(1-\delta)+\delta \exp (b_1^\#-b_2)]),  \label{rbar1sharp_E}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $b_1^\#$ is distributed in the same way as $b_1$, but is independent of it and $b_2$. 
Then $\bar r_1 - \bar r_1^\#$ is the contribution of EC covariance to the mean growth rate species 1, the invader. 
We know, a priori, that the mean growth rate of the resident, species 2, must be 0, $\bar r_2 =0$, but equation (\ref{model_eq}) also implies that

\begin{equation}
\frac{N_2(t+1)}{N_2(t)}=(1-\delta)+\delta N \frac{B_2(t)}{B_1(t)N_1(t)+B_2(t)N_2(t)}.  \label{sp2_Nt+1_over_Nt}
\end{equation}

\noindent Setting $N_2=N$ and $N_1=0$ then gives

\begin{equation}
\frac{N_2(t+1)}{N_2(t)}=(1-\delta)+\delta=1  \label{sp2_Nt+1_over_Nt_simp}
\end{equation}

\noindent so

\begin{equation}
\EX(\ln (\frac{N_2(t+1)}{N_2(t)}))=0, \label{r2_is_zero}
\end{equation}

\noindent as expected. 
Again, following REF, we also define

\begin{equation}
\bar r_2^\#=\EX(\ln [(1-\delta)+\delta \exp(b_2^\#-b_2)]),  \label{rbar2sharp_E}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $b_2^\#$ is distributed in the same way as $b_2$, but is independent of it and of $b_1$. 
Thus $\bar r_2- \bar r_2^\# = -\bar r_2^\#$ is the contribution of EC covariance to the mean growth rate of species 2, the resident. 
And so

\begin{equation}
\Delta I=\left(\bar r_1 - \bar r_1^\#\right)-\left(\bar r_2- \bar r_2^\#\right)=\bar r_1 - \bar r_1^\#+\bar r_2^\#  \label{DeltaI}
\end{equation}

\noindent has been defined in terms of expected values of elementary expressions of the random variables $\left(b_1,b_2\right)$, $\left(b_1^\#,b_2\right)$, and $\left(b_2^\#, b_2\right)$.

Having already specified that $b_1$ (and therefore also $b_1^\#$) is distributed as $N\left(\mu_1, \sigma^2\right)$, and that $b_2$ (and therefore also $b_2^\#$) is distributed as $N\left(\mu_2, \sigma^2\right)$, we know, using $\Sigma$ as notation for a covariance matrix that

\begin{equation}
\left(b_1^\#, b_2\right) \sim N\left((\mu_1,\mu_2),\Sigma \right) \label{b1sharpb2_distribution}
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation}
\left(b_2^\#, b_2\right) \sim N(( \mu_2,\mu_2), \Sigma) \label{b2sharpb2_distribution}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2&0\\0&\sigma^2\end{pmatrix}. \label{Sigmamat_cov0}
\end{equation}

\noindent Thus the difference $b_1^\#-b_2$ that occurs in the expression for $\bar r_1^\#$ (\ref{rbar1sharp_E}) is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu_1-\mu_2$ and variance $2\sigma^2$. 
Thus

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1^\#=\EX(\ln [(1-\delta)+\delta \exp(u)]),  \label{rbar1sharp_E_usub}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $u \sim N(\mu_1-\mu_2,2\sigma^2)$. 
Likewise, the difference $b_2^\#-b_2$ in (\ref{rbar2sharp_E}) is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu_2-\mu_2=0$ and variance $2\sigma^2$, so

\begin{equation}
\bar r_2^\#=\EX(\ln [(1-\delta)+\delta \exp(u)]),  \label{rbar2sharp_E_usub}
\end{equation}

\noindent where now $u \sim N(0,2\sigma^2)$. 
The expression (\ref{rbar1_E}) for $\bar r_1$ can also be further simplified, in a similar way, when we are in the symmetric tail association case considered in section \ref{sect:noise}. 
In that case,

\begin{equation}
(b_1,b_2) \sim  N(( \mu_1,\mu_2), \Sigma) \label{b1b2_distribution_sym}
\end{equation}

\noindent where now

\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2&\rho\\\rho&\sigma^2\end{pmatrix} \label{Sigmamat_rho}
\end{equation}

\noindent and $rho=put in value$ was determined as in section \ref{sect:noise}.
Therefore, the expression $b_1-b_2$ that occurred in \ref{rbar1_E}, in the symmetric tail association case, is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu_1-\mu_2$ and variance

\begin{align}
\VarX(b_1-b_2)&=\CovX(b_1-b_2, b_1-b_2) \\
                        &=\CovX(b_1,b_1)+\CovX(b_2,b_2)-\CovX(b_1,b_2)-\CovX(b_2,b_1) \\
                        &=2\sigma^2-2\rho.
\end{align}

\noindent Thus, again only in the symmetric tail association case,

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1 = \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u)]), \label{rbar1_E_usub}
\end{equation}

\noindent where here $u \sim N(\mu_1-\mu_2, 2\sigma^2-2\rho)$. 
As for all we know there is no simplicifaction of the expression \ref{rbar1_E}  for $\bar r_1$ in the left and right-tail association cases. 

Thus for in summary,

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1 = \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u)]), u \sim N(\mu_1-\mu_2, 2\sigma^2-2\rho), \label{sym_rbar1}
\end{equation}

\noindent for the symmetric case, and 

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1^{\#} = \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u)]), u \sim N(\mu_1-\mu_2, 2\sigma^2), \label{sym_rbar1sharp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\bar r_2^{\#} = \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u)]), u \sim N(0, 2\sigma^2). \label{sym_rbar2sharp}
\end{equation}

\noindent We next use the expressions to develop methods to estimate $\bar r_1$ and $\Delta I$ for any given paramters $\delta,\mu_1,\mu_2,\sigma$.




\section{Estimating $\bar r_1$ and $\Delta I$}

First, for a large integer $M$, carry out the following steps once:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate left-tail assocated noise $\left(\tilde b_{l1}^{(i)}, \tilde b_{l2}^{(i)}\right)$, $i=1,...,M$, as described in the section \ref{sect:noise}. Hence $\tilde b_{l1}^{i)}$ and $\tilde b_{l2}^{(i)}$ are distributed as $N(0,1)$. 
\item Generate right-tail associated noise $\left(\tilde b_{r1}^{(i)}, \tilde b_{r2}^{(i)}\right)$, $i=1,...,M$, via the analogous procedure. Again, $\tilde b_{r1}^{i)}$ and $\tilde b_{r2}^{(i)}$ are distributed as $N(0,1)$. 
\item Generate $M$ points $\tilde u_i$, $i = 1,...,M$ from a standard normal distribution. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Next, given values of parameters $\delta, \mu_1, \mu_2$, and $\sigma$, proceed as follows to get estimates of $\bar r_1, \bar r_1^{\#}, \bar r_2^{\#}$, and $\Delta I$. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Estimate $\bar r_1$ for the left-tail associated case as $\hat{\bar r_1} = \mean_i (\ln [1-\delta+\delta\exp(b_{l1}^{(i)}-b_{l2}^{(i)})])$ where $b_{l1}^{(i)} = \sigma \tilde b_{l1}^{(i)} + \mu_1$ and $b_{l2}^{(i)} = \sigma \tilde b_{l2}^{(i)} + \mu_2$. The standard error of this estimate is $\se (\hat{\bar r_1}) =\frac{\sd _i (\ln[1-\delta +\delta \exp(b_{l1}^{(i)}-b_{l2}^{(i)})])}{\sqrt M}$, where $\sd _i(\cdot)$ is standard deviation. 

\item Estiate $\bar r_1$ for the left-tail associated case as $\hat{\bar r_1} = \mean_i (\ln [1-\delta+\delta\exp(b_{r1}^{(i)}-b_{r2}^{(i)})])$ where $b_{r1}^{(i)} = \sigma \tilde b_{r1}^{(i)} + \mu_1$ and $b_{r2}^{(i)} = \sigma \tilde b_{r2}^{(i)} + \mu_2$. The standard error of this estimate is $\se (\hat{\bar r_1}) =\frac{\sd _i (\ln[1-\delta +\delta \exp(b_{r1}^{(i)}-b_{r2}^{(i)})])}{\sqrt M}$. 

\item Estimate $\bar r_1$ in the symmetric tail association case as $\hat{\bar r_1}=\mean_i(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_i)])$, where $u_i = \sqrt{(2\sigma^2-2\rho)}\tilde u_i + \mu_1 - \mu_2$. The standard error of this estimation is $\se(\hat{\bar r_1}) = \frac {\sd_i(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_i)])}{\sqrt M}$. 

\item Estimate $\bar r_1^{\#}$ (for all three tail-assocaition cases) as $\hat{\bar r_1^{\#}} = \mean_i(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_i)])$, where $u_i = \sqrt{2\sigma^2}\tilde u_i + \mu_1 - \mu_2$. The standard error is $\se(\hat{\bar r_1^{\#}}) = \sd_i \frac{ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_i)]}{\sqrt M}$.    

\item Estimate $\bar r_2^{\#}$ (for all three tail-assocaition cases) as $\hat{\bar r_2^{\#}} = \mean_i(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_i)])$, where $u_i = \sqrt{2\sigma^2}\tilde u_i$. The standard error is $\se(\hat{\bar r_2^{\#}}) = \sd_i \frac{ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_i)]}{\sqrt M}$.    

\item $\hat {\Delta I} = \hat{\bar r_1} - \hat{\bar r_1^{\#}} + \hat{\bar r_2^{\#}}$, estimated separately for the left-tail associated, right-tail associated and symmetric noise cases. We obtained conservative standard error estimates by adding the standard error of the estimates of $\hat{\bar r_1}, \hat{\bar r_1^{\#}}$, and $\hat{\bar r_2^{\#}}$.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent For large enough $M$, standard error should be very small. Since random variables are generated once only, computation of these quantitaties for a large number of parameter sets should be fast. 


\section{Additional quantities influencing invasion success} \label{sect:addquant}

Not only does the expected value $\bar r_1$ influence the capacity for species 1 to invade where rare, but so do other aspects of the distribution of
\begin{equation}
r_1 = \ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(b_1-b_2)]. \label{r1_distribution}
\end{equation}

We here elaborate how some other aspects of the distribution of $r_1$ were quantified, for our three tail association cases and for any of our parameters $\delta, \mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma$. 

First, we considered $\sd(r_1)$, the standard deviation. If this is large enough, then $r_1$ can occasionally be positive even if $\bar r_1$ is strongly negative, and this invasion can occur under the right environmental circumstances.

We also considered the probability $\Prob[r_1 >0]$, which is, explicitly, the probability that environmental variables that permit invasion. We have
\begin{align}
\Prob[r_1>0] &= \Prob [1-\delta+\delta \exp(b_1-b_2) > 1] \\
&= \Prob[\exp (b_1-b_2)>1] \\
&= \Prob[b_1>b_2],
\end{align}

\noindent so this was computed for each considered parameter set of $\delta, \mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma$, and for each of our three tail association cases. 

We also consider the mean value of the possible part of the distribution of $r_1$, $\EX(r_1|r_1>0)$. 
This characterizes how quickly invasion may happen, when it happens, with larger values corresponding to faster invasion. 
If it takes several time steps for the population of the invader to rise from negligible level at which species 1 is a noticeable presence in the community, then environmental conditions must be suitable for invasion for several sequential time steps. 
Thus large values of $\EX(r_1|r_1>0)$ should also correspond to a greater probability of invasion because they should correspond to faster invasions and therefore to reduced need for sequential periods of suitable environmental conditions. 

Finally, for a few choices of parameters $\delta, \mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma$, we displayed the whole distribution of $r_1$, values for each of our tail association cases, to make visual comparisons. 

\section{Symmetries and parameter reduction}

The quantities we consider to address invasion prospects for the weaker competitor, species 1 (see sections \ref{sect:IGR} and \ref{sect:addquant}) depend only on $\mu_1-\mu_2$ and not, independtly, on $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, and also are the same for our left- and right-tailed association cases. We prove these statements in this section.

Equations \ref{sym_rbar1} - \ref{sym_rbar2sharp} obviously depend only on $\mu_1-\mu_2$, and not independently on $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, since only $\mu_1-\mu_2$ appears in these expressions if $\mu_1$ or $\mu_2$ appear at all. 
Equation \ref{rbar1_E} is $\bar r_1$ in the asymmetric tail association cases.
But letting $\beta_1 = b_1 + \eta$ and $\beta_2 = b_2 + \eta$ and substituting into \ref{rbar1_E}, we get 

\begin{align}
\bar r_1 &= \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(\beta_1-\eta-(\beta_2-\eta))])\\
&= \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(\beta_1-\beta_2)]).
\end{align}
\noindent And so altering the mean of both $b_1$ and $b_2$ distributions by the same amount has no affect of $\bar r_1$, and thus $\bar r_1$ in the asymmetric tail associations also depends only on $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ and not independtly on $\mu_1$ or $\mu_2$.

In section \ref{sect:addquant}, we introduce several other metrics. These are all based on the distribution 
\begin{equation}
r_1=\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(b_1-b_2)]. \label{r1distribution}
\end{equation}

\noindent But, again making the substitutions $\beta_1 = b_1 + \eta$ and $\beta_2 = b_2 + \eta$, we can see via the same resoning as above that the whole distribution $r_1$ depends only on $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, and not on $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ independently, for all three of our tail association cases.

To see that our various metrics are the same for out left- and right-tail associated noise processes, let $(b_1,b_2)$ denote our left-tail associated random variable with parameters $\mu_1,\mu_2,\sigma$. 
Then define $\beta_1 = -b_2 + \mu_1 +\mu_2$, $\beta_2=-b_1+\mu_1+\mu_2$. 
It is easy to see that $\EX(\beta_1)=\mu_1$, $\EX(\beta_2)=\mu_2$, $\sd(\beta_1)=\sd(\beta_2)=\sigma$, so $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are normally distributed.
From there it is easy to see that $\beta_1$ and $beta_2$ are distributed in the same wat as our right-tail associated noise with parameter $\mu_1,\mu_2$, and $\sigma$. 
Making the substitutions $b_2 = -\beta_1 + \mu_1 + \mu_2$ and $b_1 = -\beta_2 + \mu_1+\mu_2$ in \ref{r1distribution}, we get

\begin{align}
r_1 &= \ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(-\beta_2+\mu_1+\mu_2-(\beta_1+\mu_1+\mu_2))]\\
&= \ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(\beta_1-\beta_2)].
\end{align}

\noindent And since $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$ is distributed in the same way as our right-tail associated noise, this proves all metrics based on the distribution of $r_1$ (\ref{r1distribution}) are the same for left- and right-tail associated noise.




\section{Decomposition}\label{Decomposition}

To quantify the contribution of different drivers to the difference in growth rate between the invader and the resident, the amount variance due to that driver is considered. We consider the contributions of the null growth rate, $\epsilon^0$, the contribution of variance in E (environment), $\bar \epsilon^E$, the contribution of the variance in C (competitive pressure), $\bar \epsilon^C$, the contrubition of E and C co-varying $\bar \epsilon^{(EC)}$, and the the contribtion of E and C varying, but independently, $\bar \epsilon^{(E\#C)}$, for the invader and the resident. The difference between invader and resident is computed term by term to get a full decomposition as follows,

\begin{equation}
\bar r_1-\bar r_2 = \Delta^0+\Delta^E+\Delta^C+\Delta^{(EC)}+\Delta^{(E\#C)}, \label{IGR}
\end{equation}

\noindent where each $\Delta$ denotes a drivers contribution the the invader growth rate subtracted by the drivers contribution to the resident's groeth rate.

The null growth rate is computed as the growrth rate when both drivers (E and C) are set at their mean. Recalling the growth rate eqaution from equation \ref{rbar1_E},

\begin{align}
\Delta^0 &= \epsilon_1^0 - \epsilon_2^0\\
&=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_1}{\bar B_2}) - \ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_2}{\bar B_2})\\
&=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_1}{\bar B_2}) - 0. \\
%&=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \exp(\bar b_1-\bar b_2)
\end{align}

The contribution of variance in E to a species growth rate is computed by letting E vary and setting C to its mean, subtracted by the null. The contribution of variance in C to a species' growth rate is computed in an analogous way, but reverse.

\begin{align}
\Delta^E &= \bar \epsilon_1^E - \bar \epsilon_2^E\\
&=[\EX (\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_1}{\bar B_2}]) - \epsilon_1^0] - [\EX(\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{ B_2}{\bar B_2}]) - \epsilon_2^0]\\
&=\EX (\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_1}{\bar B_2}]) - \epsilon_1^0 - \EX(\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{ B_2}{\bar B_2}]) \\
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\Delta^C &= \bar \epsilon_1^C - \bar \epsilon_2^C\\
&=[\EX (\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_1}{B_2}]) - \epsilon_1^0] - [\EX(\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_2}{B_2}]) - \epsilon_2^0]\\
&=\EX (\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_1}{B_2}]) - \epsilon_1^0 - \EX(\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_2}{B_2}]) \\
\end{align}


The contribution of E and C both varying but not together is computed by letting both terms vary but decoupling any association by substituting in a new independent varibable for one of the varibales. Here we use C. The term is subtracted by the previous contributions.

\begin{align}
\Delta_1^{(E\#C)} &= \bar \epsilon_1^{(E\#C)} - \bar \epsilon_2^{(E\#C)}\\
&=[\EX(\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_1}{B_2^{\#}}]) -[\epsilon_1^0 +\bar \epsilon_1^E + \bar \epsilon_1^C]] - [\EX(\ln[1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_2}{B_2^{\#}}]) -[\epsilon_2^0 +\bar \epsilon_2^E + \bar \epsilon_2^C]]\\
\end{align}

The contribution of E and C co-varying is the storage effect. Computed by, 

\begin{equation}
\Delta^{(EC)} = \bar \epsilon_1^{(EC)} - \bar \epsilon_2^{(EC)}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Where,

\begin{align}
\bar \epsilon_i^{(EC)}&=\bar \epsilon_i^{EC}-\bar \epsilon_i^{(E\#C)}\\
&= \EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_j}))-[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C]\\
&- \EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_j^{\#}})) +[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C].

By substituting these expansions into \ref{IGR}, we get, 

Recall from main text that the goal of this research is to investigate the implications of extreme events and thus asymmetric tail associations on coexistence. Hence, we compare IGR and mechanism values for each noise type. Because only association structure and not means and standard deviation is differ across noise types, different noise types will not result in differences in any of the decomposition terms outside of the storage effect term. All other terms do not consider the associative relationship between the two variables. The null growth grate is a constant that depends on the mean of both variables, the contribution of variance in one variable only depends on that one variable scaled by the mean of the other, and the varying but independent term while it does consider both variable they are set to be completely uncorrelated. These four terms will not differ across noise types. 

\section{new decomposition term}

A new decomposition term was proposed to quantify the effect of asymmetric associations to coexistence. Since asymmetry only differs in the storage effect term, $\bar \epsilon^{(EC)}$, the contribution of asymmetry associations between the species will be a further decomposition. 

\begin{equation}
\bar \epsilon^{(\dot {EC})} = \bar \epsilon^{(EC)} - \bar \epsilon^{( {EC_0})}
\end{equation}

The contribution of asymmetry to the storage effect is the observed storage effect subtracted by a null storage effect if the association between species was completely symmetrical. 
The descrition of $\bar \epsilon^{(\ddot {EC})}$ is given in section 3 and equations 9 and 21-23. 

\begin{equation}
\bar \epsilon^{( {EC_0})} = \bar r_1 - \bar r_1^{\#} + \bar r_2^{\#},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $ \bar r_1, \bar r_1^{\#}$ and $\bar r_2^{\#}$ are in the symmetric case. In our model,

\begin{equation}
\bar \epsilon^{( {EC_0})} = \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_1)]) - \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_1^{\#})]) + \EX(\ln[1-\delta+\delta \exp(u_2^{\#})]),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $u_1 \sim N(\mu_1-\mu_2, 2\sigma^2-2\rho)$, $u_1^{\#} \sim N(\mu_1-\mu_2, 2\sigma^2)$, and $u_2^{\#} \sim N(0, 2\sigma^2)$

\noindent *Note that the contribution of asymmetry to storage effects is not the same as the storage effect that we computed above for asymmetriv cases. 

In generalized terms, this further decomposition could be applied to test for contributions of asymmetry between any two variables. Here we tested the asymmetry between $b_1$ and $b_2$. Why did we not look at E and C? Do they have to be normally distrubuted?

This break down would only work if the variables are normally distributed. Thus one can convert their distribution to normal to impliment this decomposition.
