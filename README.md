## Introduction

This repository can be used to reproduce the complete analyses behind the paper "Relationships in the extremes and their 
influence on competition and coexistence" and to recompile the paper itself.

## How to run analyses and compile paper

To reproduce the analyses: 1) make your R working directory the ``code'' directory; 2) run MASTER.R. All results will be
saved to one of the results directories.  








Need to mention: 
You run the code (MASTER.R) with the R working directory equal to the code directory
